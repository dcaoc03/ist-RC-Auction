# Socket Programming Project - RC Auction
This project was developed for the Computer Networks course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico in the school year 2023/2024. It consists of two C++ programs, the Auction Server (AS) and the User Application (User), which operate simultaneously on different machines and communicate through the internet (the AS must run on a machine with known IP address and ports). The user can login, open/close auctions and bid on others' auctions. The results of these interactions are made persistent by the creation of files containing relevant information.
